title New Note_SPA POST

Browser->Server: HTTP: POST (JSON format) https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
Server-->Browser: Status Code 201, Created.

note over Server:
Server does not call for a redirect this time. 
This means that the browser now stays on the same side without sending further 
http requests to html, css and js files.
end note:

note over Browser:
Browser executes the event handler
Event handler immediately calls e.preventDefault() to prevent the default handling of form submit,
thus avoiding a redirect.
Pushes the new note to the list and browser now renders the notes to display.
 
end note
